    "# Conversational Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversational memory is how chatbots can respond to our queries in a chat-like manner. It enables a coherent conversation, and without it, every query would be treated as an entirely independent input without considering past interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The memory allows a _\"agent\"_ to remember previous interactions with the user. By default, agents are *stateless* — meaning each incoming query is processed independently of other interactions. The only thing that exists for a stateless agent is the current input, nothing else.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many applications where remembering previous interactions is very important, such as chatbots. Conversational memory allows us to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we'll explore this form of memory in the context of the LangChain library.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by importing all of the libraries that we'll be using in this example."

      "AI: There are a number of challenges to integrating large language models with external knowledge. These challenges include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Data sparsity.** One challenge is that the amount of external knowledge available is often limited. This can make it difficult for large language models to learn the relationships between different concepts and entities.\n",
      "* **Heterogeneity of data.** Another challenge is that the data available is often heterogeneous. This means that it is stored in different formats and comes from different sources. This can make it difficult for large language models to access and process the data effectively.\n",
      "* **Biases in data.** Finally, a challenge is that the data available is often biased. This means that it reflects the perspectives and experiences of a particular group of people. This can make it difficult for large language models to generate unbiased and impartial results.\n",
